# Meine Vision

Our teaching relies on *live coding*.
Instead of presenting slides to learners,
instructors write code as they go along,
using whatever tools they would use in real life.
Live coding's advantages are:

1.  Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching
    someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
    code.

1.  It enables instructors to be more responsive to "what if?"
    questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, live coding
    allows instructors to go off road and follow their learners'
    interests.

1.  People learn more than we realize we are teaching by watching
    *how* instructors do things.

1.  It slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as
    she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners,
    rather than ten times faster as she could with slides.

1.  Learners get to see instructors' mistakes *and how to diagnose
    and correct them*. Novices are going to spend most of their time
    doing this, but it's left out of most textbooks.

1.  Watching instructors make mistakes shows learners that it's all
    right to make mistakes of their own.  Most people model the behavior of
    their teachers: if the instructor isn't embarrassed about making and
    talking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so
    too.

Live coding doesn't make slides irrelevant.
Instead, they serve two purposes:

1.  Instructors read them *before* the lesson to be sure they have a
    clear picture of the lesson's flow.

1.  Learners read them *after* the lesson for review and reference.
    They can also be given a printed copy of the slides to mark up
    during the lesson so that they don't have to take notes from
    scratch.
